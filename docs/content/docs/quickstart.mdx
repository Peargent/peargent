In this chapter, we will create a simple AI agent using Peargent. <br />
Follow the steps below to get started quickly.

## Create Your First Agent

### Install Peargent
It's recommended to install Peargent inside an **virtual environment (venv)**.
```bash tab="pip"
pip install peargent
```
### Create an Agent
Now, let’s create our first **<u>Agent</u>**.
An agent is simply an AI-powered entity that behaves like an autonomous helper, it can think, respond, and perform tasks based on the role, personality, and instructions you provide.<br />

Start by creating a Python file named `quickstart.py`.
Using the `create_agent` function, we can assign our agent a `name`, a `description`, and a `persona` (its role, tone, and behaviour).<br />

You will also need to specify the `model` parameter to choose which LLM the agent will use.
In this example, we’ll use OpenAI’s `GPT-5` model. (**<u>Available models</u>**)<br />

Your agent can be anything you imagine!<br />
For this example, we’ll create a friendly agent who speaks like **William Shakespeare**.
```python tab="quickstart.py"
from peargent import create_agent
from peargent.models import openai
```
